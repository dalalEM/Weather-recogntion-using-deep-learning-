# Weather-recogntion-using-deep-learning-
This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the VGG16 architecture to classify weather conditions using "The Weather Phenomenon Database (WEAPD)."
there are 2 files:
1. VGG16_Model: includes the code. 
2. Weather recognition report.
3. [you can find the dataset here](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/M8JQCR)
