# Weather-recogntion-using-deep-learning-
This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the VGG16 architecture to classify weather conditions using "The Weather Phenomenon Database (WEAPD)."
there are 4 different files:
1. VGG16_Model: includes the code. 
2. dataset(WEAPD): A folder that contains the original data before split.
3. Data: contains the dataset after splitting.
4. Weather recognition report.
